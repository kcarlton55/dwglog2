<h2>Importing from the old database:</h2>
    <p>The data from the current drawing log program, roughly 22,000 rows of
    data, can be exported to an Excel file.  There is a computer program
    prepared (written by Ken Carlton) that can parse that data and place it
    into a database file that the new dwglog2 program can use.</p>
    <i><p style="text-align:center;"><a href="#top">back to top</a></p></i>


<a id="sqlite">
<h2>SQLite:</h2>
    <p>The dwglog2 program has built into it a database program called
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQLite" target="_blank">SQLite</a>
    that it runs in the background.  SQLite stores and manages the data that
    the dwglog2 program generates.  SQLite does the same function as Microsoft
    SQL Server that is currently used at Dekker to manage the data from
    SiteLine.  The primary difference is that SQLite saves its data in a
    stand-along file that can be located anywhere on the Dekker network,
    whereas Microsoft SQL Server saves its data in a secret type, reserved
    location.  This reserved location is meant to better secure the data.
    Plus it acts to potentially provide worldwide access (like that of
    amazon.com) to the data. On the other hand the security on the SQLite
    file depends on access rigthts that have been set up on it.</p>

    <p>Though not very well known, SQLite is one of the
    <a href="https://sqlite.org/famous.html" target="_blank">
        most widely used</a>
    SQL databases.  It is used on commercial airlines
    <a href="https://www.airbus.com/aircraft/passenger-aircraft/a350xwb-family.html"
        target="_blank">
        (Airbus),</a> it is embeded into Windows 10, and it is used
    in most cell phones.  Like Microsoft SQL Server, it is
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID" target="_blank">
        ACID compliant</a> meaning it securely manages simultaneous
    read/writes of data coming from mulitple users.  And like Microsoft SQL
    Server, SQLite can handle millions of lines of data.

<a id="dwglog2.db">
<h2>dwglog2.db:</h2>

    <p>The dwglog2 program stores data in a database file named dwglog2.db.
    This file should be in the same folder that the dwglog2 executable program
    is located. Or the file dwglog2.db can be a sybolic link to the file at
    some other location in the network. </p>

    <p>dwglog2.db should be in a location where it can be backed up regularly.
    Preferably the properties of file will prevent it from being deleted,
    except by the administor, but the file should have read/write rights for
    those users who will need to use the dwglog2 program.</p>

    <i><p style="text-align:center;"><a href="#top">back to top</a></p></i>


<a id="install">
<h2>How to install the dwglog2 program</h2>

    <p>The dwglog2 program was converted from a readable python file (text
    file) named dwglog2.py to the executable file named dwglog2.exe by use
    of a program called
    <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pyinstaller/">pyinstaller</a>.
    Pyinstaller places the exe file that it creates into a folder alongside
    of support files.  The support files permit the exe file to run without
    having to having to have Python library files present.  (Also in the
    folder should be dwglog2_help.html and dwglog2_administration_help.html
    files, and the directory named <i>icon</i> which has icon files that
    dwglog2 calls upon.)

    <p><b>The folder is named dwglog2</b>.  If the folder and its contents are
    placed on users' local hard drives, the dwglog2.exe program will load
    a second or two faster.  Otherwise the folder can be on a network drive.
    A symbolic link should be made to the dwglog2.exe file so that the
    link will show at a convenient location, such as on the userâ€™s desktop.</p>

    <i><p style="text-align:center;"><a href="#top">back to top</a></p></i>


<a id="descrips">
<h2>descriptions.py:</h2>
    <p>As the dwglog2 program is operating it suggests part descriptions based
    on the leading four digits of a part number.  Additional part descriptions
    can be added by creating a file named descriptions.py and placing the the
    first four digits of part numbers along side of corresponding descriptions.
    </p>

    <p>The description.py file should be in the same folder that the dwglog2
    executable file is located.  The descriptions.py file is optional.  The
    program can run without it.  Or the file description.py can be a sybolic
    link to the file at some other location in the network.</p>

    <p>The data in the description.py file should be in the format used in the
    computer program called Python.  That is, the data in description.py is
    actually a small snippit of computer code.  I'll explain that code so that
    no programming knowledge will be required to update or create the file.</p>

    <p>First of all, if it does not already exist, create, using a text editor
    like notepad, a text file, but instead of having <i>txt</i> as a file extension,
    use <i>py</i> as the extension.  If the file already exist, use a text editor like
    notepad to edit it.  As metioned above, that file should be in the same
    folder as the dwglog2 executable.</p>

    <p>The code in the file is what is called a Python dictionary. For our
    case, the dictionary starts out with the variable name, <i>decriptions</i>,
    followed by an equals sign, and followed by the dictionary. The dictionary
    is surrounded by brackets, {}.  Within the brackets are the pn/desription
    values.  That is, in your descriptions.py file you will have text like
    this:</p>

    <i>descriptions = {2200:'J-BOX ?',<br />
    2204:'CTRL PNL MANUAL MOTOR STARTER ??V ',<br />
    2210:'CTRL/LAYOUT PNL ??V ??HP',<br />
    4700:'KIT ?', <br />
    6810:'SUB ASSY COOLER PACK ?',<br />
    6855:'SUB ASSY ??"HOSE X ??" LG STAND',<br />
    6881:'SUB ASSY CONDENSER PKG ??GAL CS'}<br /> </i>

    <p>By the way, a part no. like 0300 with its leading 0 is unacceptable.  Use
    300 instead.  Any duplicate nos. in descriptions.py will supersede those
    in the dwglog2 program.</p>

    <p>If there are any missing or misplaced commas, colons, quote marks, etc., the
    descriptions.py will not be implemented.  For more information about python
    dictionaries see:

    <a id="sourcefiles">
    <h2>Source files:</h2>
    <p>The dwglog2 program was written using the computer language called
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)"
    target="_blank">Python</a>.  The source files from which this program was
    generated can be found in the folder named <i>sourcefiles</i> which is in
    the same folder that contains the dwglog2.exe program.  Look for the
    files that have <i>.py</i> as file extensions.  These are text files that
    can be opened with a text editor like Notepad or WordPad.  It is better
    to use WordPad since Notepad most likely won't properly handle end-of-line
    characters thereby causing all the lines to run together.</p>
