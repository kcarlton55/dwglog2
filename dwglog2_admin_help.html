<h2>Importing from the old database:</h2>
    <p>The data from the current drawing log program, roughly 22,000 rows of
    data, can be exported to an Excel file.  I, Ken Carlton, have a program 
    prepared that can parse that data and place it into a database file that
    the new dwglog2 program can use.</p>
    <i><p style="text-align:center;"><a href="#top">back to top</a></p></i>

<a id="dwglog2.db">
<h2>dwglog2.db:</h2>

    <p>The dwglog2 program stores data in a database file named dwglog2.db.  
    This file should be in the same folder that the dwglog2 executable program
    is located. Or the file dwglog2.db can be a sybolic link to the file at 
    some other location in the network. </p>

    <p>dwglog2.db should be in a location where it can be backed up regularly. 
    Preferably the properties of file will prevent it from being deleted, 
    except by the administor, but the file should have read/write rights for
    those users who will need to use the dwglog2 program.</p>

    <p>The dwglog2.db file is accessed and updated by a program internal to the
    dwglog2 program called sqlite.  Sqlite is a sql data management program 
    capable of handling millios of lines of data, and it operates similarly to
    Microsoft SQL Server which is used at Dekker, but it is meant to be used on 
    a local network rather than a global network like amazon.com.  Sqlite is 
    robust.  For example, it has been approved by the FAA to be used on
    airlines.</p>

<a id="language">
<h2>In what computer language was dwglog2 written?</h2>

    Actually three languages were used: <b>1.</b>
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PySide" target="_blank">PySide2</a> 
    to control the graphical user interface (GUI). <b>2.</b>
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQLite" target="_blank">SQLite</a>
    to manage the database which allows simultaneous and secure 
    (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID" target="_blank">
        ACID compliant</a>)
    transactions with the database file. And <b>3.</b> 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)"
        target="_blank">Python</a> 
    which acts as a binder and coordinator of the first two languages.

<a id="install">
<h2>How to install the dwglog2 program</h2>

    <p>The dwglog2 program was converted from a readable python file named
    dwglog2.py to the executable file named dwglog2.exe by use of a program
    called <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pyinstaller/">pyinstaller</a>.
    Pyinstaller places the exe file that it creates into a folder alongside
    of support files.  The support files permit the exe file to run without
    having to having to have Python library files present which is normally
    required (like the Python distribution that was used to create the 
    dwglog2 program: <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/">Anaconda</a>).</p>
  
    <p><b>The folder is named dwglog2</b>.  That folder and its contents should
    be placed on users' local hard drives.  A symbolic link should then be made
    to the dwglog2.exe file so that the link will show at a convenient location
    such as the user’s desktop.</p>

    <p>In the dwglog2 folder alongside the dwglog2.exe file should be placed
    the two (or more) html help files… the html files that appear when a user
    clicks on the help button in the dwglog program.  If convenient, these html
    files can be symbolic link files pointing to html files located somewhere
    on the network.  This will allow for a central location to update the html
    files if required.  This may be necessary if company policy changes in the
    future regarding, for example, allowing special formats for
    drawing numbers.</p>

    <p>See also the section above named dwglog2.db reguarding placing the
    database file in the same folder as the exe file.  And see the section
    below about adding the file named descriptions.py to the folder.</p>

    <p>The dwglog2 folder can also be placed on a network drive and ran from
    there.  That would of course make setting things up much easier.  The
    drawback with this is that the program will take about 6 seconds to start
    up.  From a local drive it takes less than two seconds.  I don’t know why
    the extra time is required.  I suspect it might have something to do with
    the antivirus program trying to ascertain what is going on.</p>

    <i><p style="text-align:center;"><a href="#top">back to top</a></p></i>  

<a id="descrips">
<h2>descriptions.py:</h2>
    <p>As the dwglog2 program is operating it suggests part descriptions based
    on the leading four digits of a part number.  Additional part descriptions
    can be added by creating a file named descriptions.py and placing the the
    first four digits of part numbers along side of corresponding descriptions.
    </p>  

    <p>The description.py file should be in the same folder that the dwglog2 
    executable file
    is located.  Or the file description.py can be a sybolic link to the file
    at some other location in the network.</p>

    <p>The data in the description.py file should be in the format used in the 
    computer program called Python.  That is, the data in description.py is 
    actually a small snippit of computer code.  I'll explain that code so that
    no programming knowledge will be required to update or create the file.</p>

    <p>First of all, if it does not already exist, create, using a text editor
    like notepad, a text file, but instead of having txt as a file extension,
    use py as the extension.  If the file already exist, use a text editor like
    notepad to edit it.  As metioned above, that file should be in the same 
    folder as the dwglog2 executable.</p>

    <p>The code in the file is what is called a Python dictionary. For our 
    case, the dictionary starts out with the variable name, "decriptions", 
    followed by an equals sign, and followed by the dictionary. The dictionary
    is surrounded by brackets, {}.  Within the brackets are the pn/desription
    values.  That is, in your descriptions.py file you will have text like 
    this:</p>

    descriptions = {2200:'J-BOX ?',<br /> 
    2204:'CTRL PNL MANUAL MOTOR STARTER ??V',<br />  
    2210:'CTRL/LAYOUT PNL ??V ??HP',<br /> 
    4700:'KIT ?', <br /> 
    6810:'SUB ASSY COOLER PACK ?',<br /> 
    6855:'SUB ASSY ??"HOSE X ??" LG STAND',<br />  
    6881:'SUB ASSY CONDENSER PKG ??GAL CS'}<br /> 

    <p>So then, the syntax should be like this: descriptions = 
    {1234:'DESCRIPTION FOR 1234', 5678:'DESCRIPTION FOR 5678'}.
    Note that a part no. like 0300, with its leading 0, is unacceptable.  It
    should be 300.  Any duplicate nos. in descriptions.py will supersede those
    in the dwglog2 program.</p>

    <p>If there are any missing or misplaced commas, colons, etc., the 
    descriptions.py will not be implemented.  For more information about python
    dictionaries see:
