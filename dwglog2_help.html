<h2>Add a new record:</h2>
    <p>Press the button that has the plus sign on it.  Enter the part no. and description.
    Other record fields (dwg no., date, author) will be automatically filled in.  If
    only the first four digits of a part no. are entered, then the remainder of the
    part no. will be filled in automatically.  For example 0300 renders 0300-2020-401.</p>

    <p>If the first four numbers and a dash, -, are entered, for example 0300-,
    then the description field will be filled with a partial
    description for you to complete.  For example 0300- will yield BASEPLATE, and
    6405- will yield CONDENSATE TANK.  Then pressing Enter will generate a
    drawing number, e.g. 0300-2020-401.


<a id="search">
<h2>Search examples:</h2>

    To search, enter a query into the box provided and push the Enter key.

<h4>&nbsp;&nbsp;query:</h4>
<ul><li>VMX0036*</li></ul>

<h4>&nbsp;&nbsp;yields:</h4>
    <ul><li><table>
        <tr><th>Dwg. no.</th><th>Part no.</th><th>Description</th><th>Date</th><th>Author</th></tr>
        <tr><td>2020808</td><td>093954</td><td>VMX0036MA1-00 460V TEFC</td><td>11/04/2020</td><td>whoyt</td></tr>
        <tr><td>2020804</td><td>093859</td><td>VMX0036KA1-00 575V TEFC</td><td>11/04/2020</td><td>kcarlton</td></tr>
        <tr><td>etc.</td></tr>
    </table></li></ul>

<h4>&nbsp;&nbsp;query:</h4>
<ul><li>09*; 0[345]/*/2020; kcarlton</li></ul>

<h4>&nbsp;&nbsp;yields:</h4>
    <ul><li><table>
        <tr><th>Dwg. no.</th><th>Part no.</th><th>Description</th><th>Date</th><th>Author</th></tr>
        <tr><td>2020811</td><td>093902</td><td>VMX0103KA1-00 460V TEFC</td><td>03/25/2020</td><td>kcarlton</td></tr>
        <tr><td>2020803</td><td>093840</td><td>RVL212HH-14 W/OPTIONS 380V/50/3</td><td>05/19/2020</td><td>kcarlton</td></tr>
        <tr><td>etc.</td></tr>
    </table></li></ul>

    Where character groups are &nbsp;<b>09*</b>,&nbsp; <b>0[345]/*/2020</b>,&nbsp; and&nbsp; <b>kcarlton</b>.
    Each group is searched individually.  The ; charater then tells the program to show only
    results that all three groups have in common.  The above example yields production 
    units (i.e. 09*) of March, April, or May (i.e. months 3 or 4 or 5) of 2020, and created by
    kcarlton. In other words, the ; character finds the intersection of search results of the three groups.

<h4>&nbsp;&nbsp;query:</h4>
<ul><li>09*; kcar*; 11/*/2020 &nbsp; or &nbsp; 09*; rcol*; 11/*/2020 &nbsp; or &nbsp; 09*; wh*; 11/*/2020</li></ul>

<h4>&nbsp;&nbsp;yields:</h4>
    <ul><li><table>
        <tr><th>Dwg. no.</th><th>Part no.</th><th>Description</th><th>Date</th><th>Author</th></tr>
        <tr><td>2020818</td><td>093798</td><td>VMXVFD0203KA2-00 460V TEFC</td><td>11/11/2020</td><td>kcarlton</td></tr>
        <tr><td>2020816</td><td>094189</td><td>RVL031H-03 PUMP W/VG 208-230/460V</td><td>11/11/2020</td><td>rcollins</td></tr>
        <tr><td>2020808</td><td>093954</td><td>VMX0036MA1-00 460V TEFC</td><td>11/04/2020</td><td>whoyt</td></tr>
        <tr><td>etc.</td></tr>
    </table></li></ul>

<p>  The "<b>or</b>" keyword means that if any or all of the intersection groups (groups with/without
     a ; characater) have results, then show any or all of those results.  The word "or" must be in lower case
     letters.  
</p>
    Note that searches are case sensitive. That is *rc* and *RC* will yield different results.

<a id="update">
<h2>Update a field:</h2>
    To update a field (a table cell), change the text in the field and then press the Enter key.


<a id="delete">
<h2>Delete a record:</h2>
    To delete a data record (a table row), enter one of the following words into the field
    that contains the drawing number: delete, remove, del, or rm.  Then press Enter.


<a id="refresh">
<h2>Refresh the table:</h2>
    While you are working on the dwglog2 program, other users simultaneously have access to
    the same data shown to you.  You may wish to push the refresh button to see changes
    other users have made while you have been working with the program.  Also, if you wish
    to assure that your data has been updated successfully, push the refresh button.  The most
    recent data will be pulled from the database. 


<a id="autocopy">
<h2>AutoCopy:</h2>
    Automatically copy contents of a clicked field (cell) to the clipboard.  That is, Ctrl-C not needed.


<a id="reserve">
<h2>Reserve a block of drawing numbers:</h2>

    Perhaps you would like to have a consecutive group of drawing numbers for your project.  
    To do that, first add a new part number.  Then to that new drawing number that appears, 
    increase its value the desired amount. A gap of drawing numbers will now exist below
    your new number. It is in that gap that you will place your new numbers. To do that, add 
    another new number and then change that drawing number to a number that will fit in the
    gap.  When you do that, you'll see the list updates and your new number will relocate
    so that it is the correct order.


<a id="overwrite">
<h2>Overwrite a drawing number:</h2>

    Depending on company policy, you can assign a different drawing number other than what
    is generated by the program. For example, if an existing drawing number is 2020866, and
    it is desired to make it better associate with a drawing for Atlas Copco, the number could
    be changed to AC20866 or some other scheme.  To do this, simply replace the drawing number
    with the number you want. If you want to go back to the <b>orignally assigned drawing number</b>, simply
    edit the number and <b>leave the field blank</b>.  The original, default number will reappear.
